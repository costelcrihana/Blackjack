		<h3>Welcome to blackjack</h3>
		<p>
			This is an attempt to implement a limited version of Blackjack according to Mindit test specifications.
			It is very rudimental in terms of user interaction but it does the job.
			<br>
			At the beginning of every round the cards are generated and shuffled.
			<br>
			Currently the hand score is not displayed but it should be correctly calculated.
			<br/>
			Also, in case any of the players hits a blackjack or scores over 21 points the game is automatically stopped.
			<br/>
			There is no limit in terms of total score.
			<br/>
			Dealer is on the left, player is on the right.
			</br>
			<br/>
			It works on Mozilla, it also works on Chrome but it has to be started with  --allow-file-access-from-files option.
